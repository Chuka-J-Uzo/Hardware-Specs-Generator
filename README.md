# Hardware-Specs-Generator
This Java program comprises different functional parts (A, B, C, & D) that can run as standalones.

## Task (PART A)

Part A of this Java program can access the system settings and values of your computer and return them as numbers, Boolean or strings.

## Task (PART B)

The codes in Part B can help you generate the operating system's properties using the "DISPLAY SYSTEM PROPERTIES” class.

## Task (PART C)

The codes in Part C presents you with multiple options using the “PRINT SYSTEM DETAILS” class.

## Task (PART D)

The codes in Part D presents the methods in PARTS A, B & C as interactive GUI Interfaces with buttons and display panels.
The Systems Class is restructured to interface neatly with the newly created SystemGUI class.
We make use of the Swing Toolkits features to generate our GUI interface.
